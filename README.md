# go_example_vanilla
A simple webpage created as a test of Go lang, using no frameworks. 

This example will be expanded to include basic features such as API calls and page routing.

Then, we will recreate exactly the same output using the most popular Go frameworks (one repository for each framework).

This should provide an easy way to compare Go vanilla and the various frameworks available.
