# go_example_vanilla
A simple page created as a test of Go lang, using no frameworks. The idea is to expand this example to include basic features such as API calls and page routing, and then create exactly the same output using the most popular Go frameworks. It is intended to serve as an easy way to compare Go vanilla and the various frameworks available.
